		Talos is a join concept developed by Oli Callaghan and Finnian Anderson, that monitors the uptime of sites, and is able to alert the monitor when the site goes down. It utilises Docker to create and destroy site health monitors, written in NodeJS, whilst also utilising Docker containers for the storage of user data, serving front-end files, and providing an interface for Alexa to read live updates on site health.
